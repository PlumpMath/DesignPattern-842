Scenario: 
	The purchasing staffs (aka logistics staff) of the XYZ Retail Company need to interact with other
	subsystems in order to place purchase orders. They need to communicate with their stock control department to
	determine the stock levels, also need to communicate with their wholesale supplier to determine availability of stock and
	finally with their bank to determine availability of sufficient funds to make a purchase.

Solution: 
	You can apply the façade design pattern to implement the above scenario.

Façade pattern: 
	The façade pattern provides an interface to large subsystems of classes. A common design goal is to
	minimize the communication and dependencies between subsystems. One way to achieve this goal is to introduce a
	façade object that provides a single, simplified interface.

Scenario: 
	The XYZ Retail wants to evaluate a strategy to determine items with description longer than 15 characters
	because it won’t fit in the invoice and items with description starting with “CD” to add piracy warning label.

Solution: 
	You can implement evaluating a strategy to determine items with description longer than 15 characters and
	description starting with “CD” applying the strategy design pattern as shown below:

Strategy pattern: 
	The Strategy pattern lets you build software as a loosely coupled collection of interchangeable parts, in
	contrast to a monolithic, tightly coupled system. Loose coupling makes your software much more extensible,
	maintainable, and reusable. The main attribute of this pattern is that each strategy encapsulates algorithms i.e. it is not
	data based but algorithm based. Refer Q12, Q64 in Java section.

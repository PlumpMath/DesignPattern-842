Scenario: 
	The employees of XYZ Retail are at various levels. In a hierarchy, the general manager has subordinates, and
	also the sales manager has subordinates. The retail sales staffs have no subordinates and they report to their immediate
	manager. The company needs functionality to calculate salary at different levels of the hierarchy.

Solution: 
	You can apply the composite design pattern to represent the XYZ Retail company employee hierarchy.
	
Composite design pattern: 
	The composite design pattern composes objects into tree structures where individual
	objects like sales staff and composite objects like managers are handled uniformly. Refer Q61 in Java section or Q25 in
	Enterprise section.

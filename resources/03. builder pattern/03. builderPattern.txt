Builder pattern: 
	The subtle difference between the builder pattern and the factory pattern is that in builder pattern, the
	user is given the choice to create the type of object he/she wants but the construction process is the same. But
	with the factory method pattern the factory decides how to create one of several possible classes based on data
	provided to it.
